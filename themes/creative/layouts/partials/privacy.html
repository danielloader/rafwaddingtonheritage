                <h2>About cookies</h2>
                <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are
                    widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide
                    information to the owners of the site. Website cookies store information on your user device, which
                    then gets sent back to that website each time you visit. Sometimes this information is essential to
                    access a website&#8217;s functions &#8211; for example if you need to log in, a cookie will allow
                    the website to recognise your log-in details.&nbsp;Cookies can also be used to build a profile of
                    your activity on a website &#8211; which pages you visit, how long you spend on each page. A
                    website may then use this information to tailor the pages that you see when you visit the site in
                    the future.</p>
                <h2>How we use cookies</h2>

                    Firefox) allow you to control cookies. You can set your browser to accept or reject all, or certain
                    cookies. You might, for example, be happy to accept a cookie that allows you to log in to a

                    also set your browser to prompt you each time a cookie is offered.</p>
